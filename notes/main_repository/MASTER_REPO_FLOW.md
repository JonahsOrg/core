## Master Repository Workflow

### **1. Master Repository Setup**

- **What**:
  - Initialize the master repository.
  - Set up necessary configurations, permissions, and integrations.
- **Why**:
  - **Foundation**: Provides a well-configured starting point.
  - **Security**: Ensures only authorized personnel can make changes.

---

### **2. Automated Submodule Addition & Initialization**

- **What**:
  - Use automation scripts or CI/CD tools to detect new sub-repositories and add
    them as submodules.
  - Initialize and update submodules automatically.
- **Why**:
  - **Efficiency**: Reduces manual effort in adding and initializing submodules.
  - **Consistency**: Ensures all submodules are set up correctly.

---

### **3. Continuous Branch Monitoring & Automated Labeling**

- **What**:
  - Implement GitHub Actions or bots to continuously monitor the state of all
    branches.
  - Automatically label branches based on their state (e.g., stale, active,
    needs review).
- **Why**:
  - **Real-time Updates**: Provides instant feedback on branch status.
  - **Developer Notification**: Keeps developers informed without manual
    intervention.

---

### **4. PR Monitoring, Automated Feedback & Changelog Generation**

- **What**:
  - Monitor pull requests for changes and run automated tests.
  - Provide automated feedback on code quality, potential issues, and test
    results.
  - Update changelogs based on PR content.
- **Why**:
  - **Immediate Feedback**: Developers are informed quickly about any issues.
  - **Quality Assurance**: Ensures code meets standards before merging.
  - **Documentation**: Keeps track of all changes for future reference.

---

### **5. Dependency Management & Security Checks**

- **What**:
  - Regularly scan dependencies for updates and security vulnerabilities.
  - Automate the update process where feasible.
- **Why**:
  - **Security**: Ensures the codebase is free from known vulnerabilities.
  - **Up-to-date Codebase**: Uses the latest and most secure versions of
    dependencies.

---

### **6. Code Compilation & Integration**

- **What**:
  - Automate the process of gathering code from submodules, compiling, and
    integrating it into the main app.
  - Run integration tests to ensure all components work together.
- **Why**:
  - **Seamless Integration**: Ensures all parts of the app function cohesively.
  - **Quality Assurance**: Verifies the integrated app's functionality.

---

### **7. Staging Deployment & Automated UAT**

- **What**:
  - Deploy the integrated app to a staging environment automatically.
  - Run user acceptance tests using automated scripts or tools.
- **Why**:
  - **Real-world Testing**: Validates the app in an environment close to
    production.
  - **Efficiency**: Reduces manual testing effort.

---

### **8. Release Automation & Documentation**

- **What**:
  - Automate the release process, including versioning, packaging, and
    deployment.
  - Generate release notes, documentation, and any necessary user guides.
- **Why**:
  - **Efficiency**: Streamlines the release process.
  - **Clarity**: Provides clear documentation for users and stakeholders.

---

### **9. Post-Release Monitoring & Training**

- **What**:
  - Monitor the app's performance and user feedback post-release.
  - Provide automated training modules or resources for significant updates.
- **Why**:
  - **Feedback Loop**: Quickly gather feedback for continuous improvement.
  - **User Adoption**: Ensures users understand and can utilize new features
    effectively.
