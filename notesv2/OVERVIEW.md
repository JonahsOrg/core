## Master Repository System Overview

### **Introduction**:

The Master Repository System is a modular approach to software development on
platforms like GitHub. It centralizes the main components of an application
within a master repository and delegates specific functionalities to
sub-repositories. Each submodule is a standalone application with its own
development lifecycle. The master repository's role is to integrate these
standalone apps into a unified, large application.

### **Components**:

1. **Master Repository**:

   - **Role**: Central hub for the entire app.
   - **Contents**: References to specific states in sub-repositories, shared
     assets, configurations, and scripts.
   - **Function**: Integration of standalone apps into a unified application,
     release management, and holistic view of the app.

2. **Sub-repositories (Standalone Apps)**:
   - **Role**: Represents distinct modules or functionalities.
   - **Contents**: Source code, assets, and documentation specific to that
     standalone app.
   - **Function**: Independent development, testing, versioning, and feature
     branching.

### **Workflow**:

1. **Initialization**:

   - Set up the master repository.
   - Integrate existing or new repositories as submodules to the master
     repository.

2. **Development in Sub-repositories**:

   - Developers work within individual sub-repositories, creating feature
     branches, making changes, adding features, and fixing bugs.
   - Each submodule maintains its own commit history, branches, and releases.

3. **Integration**:

   - The master repository pulls the desired state (e.g., a specific branch or
     commit) from each submodule.
   - Integration scripts in the master repository gather necessary code and
     assets from sub-repositories.

4. **Compilation & Release**:

   - The master repository compiles the integrated code from all
     sub-repositories into a unified application.
   - The unified app is tested, and if successful, it's released.

5. **Maintenance**:
   - Regular updates are performed on sub-repositories to ensure they're in sync
     with their remote versions.
   - The master repository is periodically updated to reflect the latest stable
     state of all sub-repositories.

### **Advantages**:

- **Modularity**: Each submodule is a standalone app, promoting clear separation
  and focused development.
- **Parallel Development**: Multiple teams can work on different standalone apps
  simultaneously.
- **Scalability**: New standalone apps or functionalities can be easily added as
  new sub-repositories.
- **Unified Compilation**: All standalone apps can be compiled into a single,
  large application.

### **Challenges**:

- **Integration Complexity**: Ensuring seamless integration of standalone apps
  can be challenging.
- **Dependency Management**: Handling interdependencies between standalone apps
  can be complex.
- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand both the submodule workflow
  and the integration process.

### **Automation & Tooling**:

- Use GitHub Actions, bots, and CI/CD pipelines for automation.
- Implement dependency management tools to ensure synchronization between
  standalone apps.
- Utilize build tools and scripts to automate the compilation of standalone apps
  into a unified application.

### **Conclusion**:

The Master Repository System offers a structured approach to developing a
large-scale app by integrating multiple standalone applications. With the right
tools and practices, it can streamline the development process and enhance code
quality.
