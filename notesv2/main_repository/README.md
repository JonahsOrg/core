## Main Repository Overview

### **Main Repository Initialization**:

- **What**:
  - Set up the main repository as the central hub for the entire project. This
    repository will not contain the actual code but will reference specific
    commits in sub-repositories (submodules).
- **Why**:
  - **Centralization**: Provides a unified point of reference for the entire
    project.
  - **Organization**: Keeps the codebase modular and organized.

---

### **Automated Submodule Creation & Tracking**:

- **What**:
  - Whenever a new feature or module is conceptualized, an automation script or
    CI/CD tool is triggered to create a new submodule repository. The main
    repository then automatically adds this new submodule for tracking.
- **Why**:
  - **Efficiency**: Reduces manual effort in creating and adding new submodules.
  - **Consistency**: Ensures all submodules are set up and tracked correctly.

---

### **Milestone Creation for Submodules**:

- **What**:
  - For each submodule, milestones are created in the main repository. These
    milestones correspond to major features or versions of the submodule. Within
    each milestone, individual feature branches or tasks from the submodule can
    be tracked.
- **Why**:
  - **Organization**: Provides a clear roadmap of the development process for
    each submodule.
  - **Progress Tracking**: Allows for easy monitoring of the progress of each
    submodule's development.

---

### **General Overview & Change Tracking**:

- **What**:
  - The main repository maintains a general overview of changes across all
    submodules. This might involve tracking merged PRs, closed issues, or other
    significant events from each submodule.
- **Why**:
  - **Holistic View**: Offers a bird's-eye view of the entire project's
    progress.
  - **Accountability**: Ensures that changes in submodules are documented and
    reviewed at the main level.

---

### **Automated Testing & Integration**:

- **What**:
  - Whenever changes are made in a submodule and it's updated in the main
    repository, automated tests are run to ensure that the changes are
    compatible with the entire system. This ensures that the integration of all
    submodules results in a functional application.
- **Why**:
  - **Quality Assurance**: Ensures that changes in one submodule don't adversely
    affect the entire application.
  - **Continuous Integration**: Streamlines the process of integrating changes
    from multiple submodules.

---

### **Release Preparation**:

- **What**:
  - Once all milestones for a particular release are achieved, the main
    repository begins the release preparation process. This involves gathering
    code from all submodules and ensuring all components are ready for the
    compilation phase.
- **Why**:
  - **Organization**: Ensures all components are in place for the final
    compilation.
  - **Deployment Readiness**: Begins the process of getting the entire
    application ready for release or deployment.

---

### **Compilation & Integration Testing**:

- **What**:
  - After the release preparation, the main repository compiles the gathered
    code into a unified application. Following the compilation, integration
    tests are run to ensure that the entire application functions cohesively.
- **Why**:
  - **Consolidation**: Combines all the components into a cohesive application.
  - **Quality Assurance**: Verifies that the integrated application functions as
    expected and is ready for deployment.

---

### **Submodule Versioning & Compatibility Checks**:

- **What**:
  - Each submodule should follow a versioning scheme (e.g., semantic
    versioning). The main repository should periodically check for compatibility
    between different versions of submodules, especially if they have
    interdependencies.
- **Why**:
  - **Compatibility**: Ensures that different versions of submodules work well
    together.
  - **Predictability**: Helps in anticipating potential issues when integrating
    different submodule versions.

---

### **Submodule Update Notifications**:

- **What**:
  - The main repository should have a mechanism (e.g., webhooks, CI/CD triggers)
    to be notified when there's an update in any of its submodules. This ensures
    that the main repository is always aware of the latest changes in its
    submodules.
- **Why**:
  - **Real-time Tracking**: Ensures that the main repository is always in sync
    with its submodules.
  - **Proactivity**: Allows the main repository to take immediate actions (like
    running tests) upon submodule updates.

---

### **Rollback Mechanism**:

- **What**:
  - In case of issues during integration or post-release, the main repository
    should have a mechanism to rollback to a previous stable state. This might
    involve reverting to previous versions of certain submodules.
- **Why**:
  - **Safety**: Ensures that in case of unforeseen issues, the application can
    be reverted to a stable state.
  - **User Trust**: Maintains user trust by ensuring continuous availability of
    a functional application.

---

### **Submodule Contribution Guidelines**:

- **What**:
  - The main repository should provide clear contribution guidelines for
    developers working on submodules. This can include coding standards, commit
    message guidelines, and other best practices.
- **Why**:
  - **Consistency**: Ensures that all submodules follow a consistent development
    pattern.
  - **Quality**: Upholds the quality of code and commits across all submodules.

---

### **Feedback Loop & Iteration**:

- **What**:
  - After a release, feedback is gathered from users, stakeholders, or automated
    monitoring tools. This feedback is then used to make improvements, fix bugs,
    or add features in the respective submodules. The main repository tracks
    these feedback items and ensures they are addressed in future milestones.
- **Why**:
  - **Continuous Improvement**: Ensures the application evolves based on user
    needs and feedback.
  - **Adaptability**: Allows the project to adapt to changing requirements or
    environments.

---

### **Documentation & Release Notes**:

- **What**:
  - Alongside the development, the main repository maintains overarching
    documentation that covers the entire application. This includes user
    manuals, developer guides, and API references. Additionally, for each
    release, detailed release notes are generated, summarizing changes from all
    submodules.
- **Why**:
  - **Clarity**: Provides clear instructions and information for both users and
    developers.
  - **Transparency**: Offers stakeholders a clear view of what has changed in
    each release.
