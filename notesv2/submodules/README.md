## Submodule Repository Overview

### **Submodule Initialization**:

- **What**:
  - Before any development begins, the submodule is initialized and added to the
    main repository. This involves creating a new repository for the submodule
    and then adding it to the main repository using git submodule commands.
- **Why**:
  - **Modularity**: Allows for independent development of different parts of the
    application.
  - **Scalability**: Enables the addition of more submodules in the future
    without affecting the existing structure.
  - **Isolation**: Each submodule can be developed, tested, and versioned
    independently.

---

### **Setting Up Development Environment**:

- **What**:
  - Configure the development environment specific to the submodule. This might
    include setting up databases, APIs, third-party services, or any other tools
    necessary for development.
- **Why**:
  - **Consistency**: Ensures all developers work in a similar environment,
    reducing "it works on my machine" issues.
  - **Efficiency**: Streamlines the development process by having all necessary
    tools and services readily available.
  - **Quality Assurance**: Ensures that the software is developed in an
    environment that closely mirrors the production environment.

---

### **Establishing Coding Standards and Guidelines**:

- **What**:
  - Before coding begins, establish coding standards, guidelines, and best
    practices for the submodule. This might include code formatting rules,
    naming conventions, and architectural patterns.
- **Why**:
  - **Consistency**: Ensures that the codebase remains consistent and readable.
  - **Maintainability**: Makes it easier for any developer to understand and
    modify the code in the future.
  - **Quality**: Adhering to best practices reduces the likelihood of bugs and
    ensures a high-quality codebase.

---

### **Idea Generation & Validation**:

- **What**:
  - Ideas for new features, enhancements, or fixes are initially drafted on a
    project board. These ideas then undergo validation involving feasibility
    checks, market analysis, or user feedback.
- **Why**:
  - **Visualization**: Provides a visual representation of the development
    pipeline.
  - **Collaboration**: Enables team discussion, prioritization, and refinement.
  - **Feasibility**: Ensures technical implementability.
  - **Value Proposition**: Validates alignment with product and company goals.

---

### **Issue Creation**:

- **What**:
  - Once the idea is fully fleshed out, including design and other necessary
    details, it's converted into an issue.
- **Why**:
  - **Documentation**: Issues provide a detailed description of the task,
    ensuring everyone understands the requirements.
  - **Tracking**: Issues can be assigned, labeled, and tracked, ensuring
    accountability and progress monitoring.

---

### **Dependency Check**:

- **What**:
  - Before starting development, check if the feature or fix has any
    dependencies, like third-party libraries or other features that need to be
    developed first.
- **Why**:
  - **Smooth Development**: Ensures that all required tools and features are
    available before starting the development.
  - **Efficiency**: Reduces the chances of development halts due to missing
    dependencies.

---

### **Feature Branch Creation & Pull Request Initiation**:

- **What**:
  - A new branch is created for each issue, ensuring isolated development. Each
    feature or fix has its own branch. A pull request (PR) is opened once a
    branch is created. Tests run automatically when a PR is made or updated.
- **Why**:
  - **Isolation**: Allows focused development.
  - **Traceability**: Links code changes to tasks.
  - **Stability**: Keeps the main branch deployable.
  - **Parallel Development**: Enables simultaneous feature development.
  - **Early Feedback**: Provides continuous feedback.
  - **Integration**: Ensures smooth code integration.
  - **Quality Assurance**: Verifies no new bugs are introduced.
  - **Immediate Feedback**: Notifies developers of test results.

---

### **Automated Labeling & Feature Development**:

- **What**:
  - An automated label "ready to code" is added to the issue. Developers then
    begin coding, periodically reviewing and refactoring the codebase. Regular
    commits are made, ideally every 5-10 minutes or after small logical changes.
    Code is documented and commented, including inline comments and README
    updates.
- **Why**:
  - **Status Indication**: Provides a visual status update.
  - **Automation**: Streamlines the process.
  - **Implementation**: Transforms ideas into functional software.
  - **Progress**: Advances the development process.
  - **Clarity**: Assists other developers.
  - **Maintainability**: Facilitates future changes and ensures easy future
    updates.
  - **Code Quality**: Enhances code efficiency.

---

### **Branch Monitoring & Labeling**:

- **What**:
  - An automated process, such as a GitHub Action or bot, periodically checks
    the state of all feature branches. If a branch is found to be 30 commits (or
    any other defined threshold) behind its target branch (e.g., main), it's
    automatically labeled as "Stale" or "Needs Rebase".
- **Why**:
  - **Automation**: Streamlines the process of branch management.
  - **Up-to-date Codebase**: Ensures branches are kept current and reduces merge
    conflicts.
  - **Developer Notification**: Keeps developers informed about the state of
    their branches, prompting them to take necessary actions.

---

### **Pull Request Updates & Changelog Generation**:

- **What**:
  - Periodically, an automated process compiles all the commits into a summary
    message and comments on the PR with this summary. Tools or scripts, such as
    standard-version or auto-changelog, automatically update the changelog based
    on commit messages or PR titles. Once the feature or fix is ready for
    review, the draft status of the PR is removed.
- **Why**:
  - **Automated Summaries**: Provides a concise overview of changes in the PR
    for reviewers.
  - **Changelog Maintenance**: Ensures that the changelog is consistently
    updated, providing a clear history of changes.
  - **Clear Communication**: Removing the draft status clearly signals to the
    team that the PR is ready for review.

---

### **Merge Conflict Resolution**:

- **What**:
  - If conflicts arise between the PR and the main branch, they are addressed by
    the developer. This typically entails rebasing the feature branch against
    the main branch and manually resolving any conflicts.
- **Why**:
  - **Code Integrity**: Ensures that the merged code is consistent and free of
    conflicts.
  - **Maintainability**: By addressing conflicts promptly, the codebase remains
    clean and easier to manage.

---

### **Developer Tagging & Code Review**:

- **What**:
  - Developers tag PRs for review when they're ready. PRs are then reviewed by
    one or more team members before merging.
- **Why**:
  - **Communication**: Notifies code reviewers.
  - **Efficiency**: Streamlines the review process.
  - **Knowledge Sharing**: Familiarizes the team with changes.
  - **Mentoring**: Helps junior developers learn.
  - **Error Detection**: Increases the chance of spotting mistakes.

---

### **Final Integration into main Repository**:

- **What**:
  - Once the PR is approved and merged into the submodule's main branch, the
    main repository is updated to point to the latest commit of the submodule.
    This integrates the finalized code from the submodule into the main
    repository.
- **Why**:
  - **Consolidation**: Ensures the main repository always references the latest
    stable version of each submodule.
  - **Preparation for Compilation**: Readies the main repository for the
    compilation of all submodules into the unified application.
